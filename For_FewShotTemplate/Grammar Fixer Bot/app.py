"""ðŸ”° Beginner Level Project: "Grammar Fixer Bot"
Description:
Create a small tool that corrects grammar in English sentences. Use a few example input-output pairs (incorrect â†’ corrected) to guide the model's behavior.

What you'll practice:

Structuring few-shot examples

Using consistent formatting ("Input: ... \nOutput: ...")

Embedding the pattern into a prompt for generalization"""
